Figure out how to get rid of the small white space around image.
<br>
<br>
Ingredients might need spaces or bullet points to make it more legible, the block of text is hard to read. 
<br>
<br>
The body text may be too large, experiment with smaller sizes.
<br>
<br>
It could be a good idea to add images between steps, especially the more complex steps. 
<br>
<br>
Smaller leading for title but font choice is good

Orange rectangle on title has a slight overlap with white space at bottom of image, this is small but distracting
<br>
<br>
Directions should have equal space under image as ingredients and the top image has.
<br>
<br>
Ingredients again need something to break up the blocks of text (bullet points, numbers, etc) 
<br>
<br>
More top padding for Cheese sauce
<br>
<br>
More top and bottom padding for second image
<br>
<br>
More bottom padding after enjoy might be necessary
